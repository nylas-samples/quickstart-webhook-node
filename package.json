  "description": "This repo contains functionality to complete two tasks: - Backend Server: A  server that will receive a request from Nylas to confirm the server endpoint is active prior to activate a Nylas Webhook. Note the backend server must be publicly available for Nylas to call, so it needs to be hosted on a service. It can be hosted locally, however, running a proxy server has been problematic due as the proxy server may restrict free use of webhook creation. - Webhook Creation Script:  The require code for creating a Nylas Webhook that can be run as a local script.",
